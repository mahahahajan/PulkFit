  "notes": "Today's workout balances your primary goals for back, chest, and shoulders, along with your secondary leg movement. You had good sleep and RHR, which supports a solid lifting session despite self-reported 'moderate fatigue'. We're progressing your pull-ups and squats based on successful completion in the last session. For Incline Bench, the slight reduction in weight while aiming for a higher rep range (5-7 reps from 4.5 reps) is intended to build more consistent and cleaner reps, addressing the previous session's performance. Focus on controlled movements and strict form to manage historical forearm tendon strain and lower back tightness. This session is your second of the week; aim for 1-2 more lifting sessions and dedicated cardio/active recovery days to meet your weekly goals and manage recovery effectively. Consider adding face pulls on a separate day or as a quick finisher if you feel you need more rear delt work for posture."
